This is a redo of the second version of Root Access. This version will have a more scalable world handling system.

  <font color="red">This text will be red.</font>

I want this markdown file to have different colors for different words. I haven't done this before but I think using HTML tags might work. Maybe <p style="color:red;">Red</p> and <p style="color:blue;">Blue</p> would do it? But how do I actually see the colors in my editor in VS code? Is it possible to change the text color while editing?
